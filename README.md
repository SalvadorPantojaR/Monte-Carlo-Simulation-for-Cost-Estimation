# Monte Carlo Simulation for Cost Estimation

This project demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis in business cost estimation. It models uncertainties in unit costs and quantities for key budget components and evaluates their impact on total cost.

Key Insights

Probability distributions applied to materials, labor, transport, and others.

Simulation with 5,000 iterations produced reliable intervals for expected total cost.

Percentiles (5%, 50%, 95%) provide a risk-aware range of outcomes.

Sensitivity analysis compared alternative distributions to assess robustness.

Visualizations

Histogram of simulated costs with mean and percentiles.

Sensitivity comparison: Normal vs Exponential distribution.

Stack

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Outcome

The notebook delivers a simulation-based approach for decision-making, showing how probability distributions affect cost uncertainty in a business scenario.
